In this mode, the instruction itself contains the actual data or constant value to be operated upon, rather 
than referencing a memory location or a register. The value is directly embedded within the instruction, 
typically in a designated field or as an operand.  Immediate addressing mode is useful for performing operations 
involving constants or immediate data, and it allows for efficient and compact code, as it eliminates the need to 
load data from memory or registers. However, it has the limitation that the immediate values are often limited in 
size, depending on the CPU architecture, and may not accommodate large data sets.
