In this mode, the instruction specifies a memory address that contains the actual address of the operand, 
rather than the operand itself. Instead of directly accessing the data or instruction, the CPU retrieves 
the memory address from the specified location and then accesses the data or instruction from that address. 
Indirect addressing is particularly useful when dealing with data structures, arrays, or dynamically changing 
memory locations, as it allows for more flexible and dynamic memory access. It enables efficient use of memory 
and simplifies the management of complex data structures, but it can also introduce an extra level of memory 
access, potentially impacting performance.
