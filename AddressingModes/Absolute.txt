 In this mode, the memory address of the operand is directly specified in the instruction. 
Instead of using a register or an offset, the instruction contains the exact memory location 
where the data or instruction resides. Absolute addressing mode allows direct access to specific 
memory locations, making it useful for accessing fixed memory locations or for interacting with 
memory-mapped devices. However, it can lead to less flexible code as memory addresses are hardcoded
into instructions, making it challenging to adapt to changes in memory layout.
