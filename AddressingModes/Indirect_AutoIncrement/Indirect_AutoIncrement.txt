In this mode, the instruction refers to a memory location specified by a register, and it indirectly accesses the data or instruction 
at that memory address. After accessing the data, the CPU automatically increments the value stored in the register to point to the 
next sequential memory location. This mode is useful for iterating through arrays or lists in memory as it simplifies sequential 
access to elements. It can be efficient for processing data structures, but programmers need to be cautious about the autoincrement
behavior to avoid potential issues like accessing unintended memory locations.
